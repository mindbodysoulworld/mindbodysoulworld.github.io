            <h2 class="about-title">What Law of attraction is?</h2>

            <p class="about-text">
Simply put, the Law of Attraction says that you will attract into your life whatever you focus on. Whatever you give your energy and attention to will come back to you.

So, if you stay focused on the good and positive things in your life, you will automatically attract more good and positive things into your life. If you are focused upon lack and negativity, then that is what will be attracted into your life.

Here’s how it works:

Like attracts like. If you are feeling excited, enthusiastic, passionate, happy, joyful, appreciative, or abundant, then you are sending out positive energy.
              </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              The Law of Attraction is one of life’s biggest mysteries. Very few people are fully aware of how much of an impact the Law of Attraction has on their day to day life. Whether we are doing it knowingly or unknowingly, every second of our existence, we are acting as human magnets sending out our thoughts and emotions and attracting back more of what we have put out.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              Unfortunately, so many of us still blind to the potential that is locked deep within us. Consequently, 
              it is all too easy to leave your thoughts and emotions unchecked. This sends out the wrong thoughts and attracts more unwanted emotions and events into your life.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              Having said this, discovering that the Law of Attraction is at work within your life should be a great cause for celebration! Once the power of attraction has been understood by you it is no longer secret. Plus, you have learned how to effectively apply these to your everyday life, your entire future is yours to create.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
The Law of Attraction is the most powerful law in the universe. Just like gravity, it is always in effect, always in motion. It is working in your life at this very moment. You are always in a state of creation. You are creating your reality in every moment of every day. You are creating your future with every single thought: either consciously or subconsciously. You can’t take a break from it and decide not to create because creation never stops.

Understanding just how the Law of Attraction is a fundamental key to your success. If you want to change your life, and empower yourself to create an amazing future, then you need to understand your role in the Law of Attraction.

Expect miracles.working consciously with your energy (thoughts, feelings and beliefs) you can make that experience more awesome.

The Law of Attraction allows for infinite possibilities, infinite abundance, and infinite joy. It knows no order of difficulty, and it can change your life in every way.

In order to really understand how the Law of Attraction works in your life, we need to look at a few things. I will explain the Law of Attraction, how to master it in your life to attract success in many areas, a meditation technique, and some tips for abundance.

Let’s start at the beginning.

            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
Once you understand the Law of Attraction, and how it works, you can begin to consciously and intentionally create a better life.

You can choose to respond differently to the situations that arise during your day.

You can choose to think differently.

You can choose to focus and think about the things you want more of in your life.

You can choose to experience more of the things that make you feel good.

You can choose to deliberately participate in the creation of your future by managing your thoughts and feelings.

Using the Law of Attraction is a three-step process: ask, believe and receive. Let’s go into detail on each aspect.
              </p>
              <p class="about-text">
                 <h2 class="service-title">1. Ask the universe for what you want, not for what you don’t want</a></h2>


Every day, you send out requests to the universe—as well as to your subconscious mind—in the form of thoughts: literally, what you think about, read about, talk about, and give your attention to. Unfortunately, what we give our attention to is often random and not deliberate, you simply respond to situations.
Because the Law of Attraction states that you’ll attract into your life whatever you give your energy, focus, and attention to—wanted or unwanted.

You must become more deliberate about what you think and feel.

To become more intentional about the thoughts you offer the universe, you’ll need to decide what you want—but also practice feeling those emotions you’ll experience when you have it.

Perhaps you want to change career, move to another state, win a major professional award, have your own TV show, or recover from a major illness.

    How would you feel once you’ve “arrived” at your goal?
    What would you be doing throughout your day?
    Who would you be spending time with?

The more you focus on and talk about what you DO want (instead of what you don’t want), the faster you will manifest your dreams and goals.
              </p>

              <p class="about-text">
                <h2 class="service-title">2. Believe that you’ll get what you want, then take action</a></h2>


What does it mean to believe you’ll get what you want?

It means maintaining a positive expectancy, going about your day with certainty— knowing that you’ve put your future in the hands of powers that are greater than yours. It’s deciding with conviction that what you want will absolutely happen.

This is not always easy.

Many people have limiting beliefs which keep them from allowing abundance and happiness into their lives. If this describes you, realize that you must first change your limiting beliefs into thoughts that you are deserving, worthy, lovable, desirable, and capable—as well as smart enough, strong enough, attractive enough, rich enough, good enough, and “enough” in every other way that matters to you.

Once you believe that you’ll get what you want, the second part of the equation is to take action.
Taking the actions that would create your desired result affirms your belief that what you want is within reach.
              </p>
               <p class="about-text">
                 <h2 class="service-title">3. Receive what you want by becoming a vibrational match for it</a></h2>


In order to receive that which you are intending, you must become a “vibrational match” for what you want to attract into your life.

The easiest way to become a vibrational match is to focus on creating positive emotions of love, joy, appreciation, and gratitude throughout your day. You can also practice feeling the emotions you would be experiencing if you already had what you wanted. You can also create these emotions through the thoughts that you think. In fact, your thoughts are creating feelings all the time, so it’s important to catch yourself when your emotions turn negative and turn them to positive emotions.

As with everything, this takes time and practice. However, the more you put a conscious effort into attracting what you want, and following these steps, the easier it will become.

You can begin to expect miracles.
               </p>


               <p  class="about-text">
                 <h2 class="service-title">The Law of Attraction in Love and Relationships</a></h2>

<br>

If you want to create an abundance of love in your life, then focus on love. Be the love you want to attract.

Become more loving and generous with others and with yourself. By creating the vibration of love, you will automatically draw more love into your life.

Focus on whatever it is that you want to create more of in your life, and remember to be grateful for that which you already have.

Gratitude itself is a form of abundance, and the vibrational frequency of gratitude and appreciation will automatically attract even more to be grateful for.
               </p>

                <p  class="about-text">
                  <h2 class="service-title">A Law of Attraction Meditation for Guidance</a></h2>

<br>
Take time each day to step away from the clutter and the noise. A daily commitment to spend time in this still, quiet place is a commitment to clarity and inner peace.

We need this time and space in our lives in order to remember who we really are, what’s important, and where our personal truth lies. It is our time to calm the spirit and soothe the soul.

You can learn how to meditate in many different ways, but in general, they consist of simply being still and quiet for a period of time and focusing your attention on either your breath or a mantra of some sort.

If you are new to the practice of meditation—your thoughts will drift, and your mind will wander at first. Remember not to be hard on yourself when this happens. This is just part of learning how to meditate.

If you have never meditated before, here’s a simple structure of exercises you can use to begin.

<br>
    1. Find a quiet place, close your eyes, and focus on slowing down your breathing.<br>
    2. Repeat an uplifting word or phrase.<br>
    3. Move into a state of quiet.<br>
    4. Imagine yourself surrounded by a sphere of light.<br>

The regular practice of meditation will help clear your mind of distractions, cleanse your thoughts, and enhance your spiritual connection. It renews the spirit, relaxes the body, and calms the soul.

        <h2 class="about-title">Visualization</h2>

        <p class="about-text">
          To achieve what you want, what you desire, needs a change in your thinking. You need to change your mindset. You need to visualize. By using this technique of visualization you will actually put yourself into any given situation.<br>

Any sports man or women at the top of there game will use visualization. If they are a high jumper they will go over and over a jump in their mind. They will live it and re-live it, step by step. A motor racer will visualize leaving the starting grid and getting ahead of the pack. They would have driven every part of the track, taken every bend or turn. They will know exactly were to brake and were to accelerate. They will have driven the racetrack a thousand times in their minds eye.<br>

Although we may not be aware of it, the brain works by visualizing pictures not by using words. Yes we use words to communicate but the brain will automatically turn these words into pictures. So that we can visualize what is being said.<br>

I once attended a seminar. The lecturer was very good, very confident and used many practical examples to explain himself. He was explaining how you can remember anything you are told, see or read if only you can visualize it. Just before the break for lunch he asked us to write our first names on a piece of paper and hold them up in front of us.<br>

On our return he asked us to sit in exactly the same place we were before lunch. Now there were around 50 people in the room. He then started to name all of us. He told you your name, the name of the person to your right, your left. The name of the person sitting in front of you and the person sitting behind you. It was truly amazing. He did this through a form of visualization. He put a picture to every person in the room. Within that picture was a story within that story was your name. So when he looked at you he just visualized his story.<br>

That was one of the greatest examples of visualization I had or have ever witnessed. But it proved his point, visualization does work. Many entertainers use this method to remember names of people in an audience. Especially comedians who “play off” many members of an audience, as part of their act.<br>

Many of us have trouble remembering things. If you can put a picture to everything you here or read with practice you will find your memory will improve.<br>

So how do we use visualization to achieve our goals?<br>

You have to use visualization to live the dream. This is the way to achieve it.<br>
I have often spoken about the universe and how all life is connected to it. This is not a new theory. Hegel, Emerson, Wallace Wattles and Napoleon Hill have covered it in great depth, back in the last century. Furthermore through many philosophers even further back in history.<br>

Here we go. You might have to read the next paragraph a couple of times to grasp the concept.<br>

If we are at one with the universe and the universe is at one with us and everything throughout the universe is connected, this must include our mind, body and soul. Then our mind must have an effect on our body and consequently our soul must have an effect on or mind. So therefore our mind must have an effect our soul.<br>

Please stay with this, as this is the fundamental principle of obtaining what you want. No, what you are entitled to.<br>

The difference between us and all other forms of life is the very fact that we have a very powerful brain. We can think, we can reason and we can invent.<br>

Everything man has created, every idea he has ever had, has been born in his brain. We have the ability to create. It could be a beautiful picture, an architectural achievement or a medical breakthrough. Whatever it may be it has to be thought of, to exist. If you purchase a new kitchen the salesman can not bring everything around to your home, take out the old kitchen and fit the new one just to see if you like it. You have to imagine what it will look like as a finished article from a few samples or a showroom display. You have to form a picture in your mind as to what it will look like in your own home.<br>

You see we form pictures in our mind all the time; it’s just that we take this ability for granted.

The other difference between us and all other forms of life is the fact that we have created a monetary world. You can do very little in this world without money. By having money is the only way you can truly have an abundant life. So if having an abundant life is an entitlement for all living things then our entitlement to money is an entitlement to live the life we are entitled to. We have the right to learn and expand our knowledge. Reading books, attending courses and traveling the world can achieve this. All this requires money. Never think great wealth is purely an entitlement for the few. It’s available to everyone.<br>

We have a very powerful tool that we carry around everyday, our brain. If you give someone a paintbrush but never show him or her how to paint they will never use it. We are given a brain at birth but if we are never shown the power within it, we will never use it.<br>

Now where were we? Oh yes, mind, body and soul.<br>

The mind is very complex but in broad terms it is simply the tool we use to learn and store information. It is a processor that enables us to use this information to its fullest extent.<br>

The body is the machine. This is the equipment that can carry out all our physical needs. It enables us to see, hear, walk, run and lift amongst other things. But most importantly it allows us to build and physically create the ideas that are pictured in our minds.<br>

It is said the soul is the very essence of life. It is the soul that makes us what we are, it is our character, our sense of humour, our emotions and the way we interpret the messages we receive from our brain. It is our spirituality it’s what makes us the person we are. Happy and wild or maybe withdrawn and miserable. Usually a combination of all these things. It is the part that connects us to the universe and all life.<br>

Remember I said earlier that every thought you have ever had has bought you to where you are now.<br>

Ask yourself. Am I happy with where I am now?<br>

The chances are the answer is NO. Very few people are. Everyone wants to advance further. Everyone wants to achieve more. They want a more abundant life.<br>

 

Mark Claridge specializes in teaching self-development skills. His new e-book “Mindset and Match” covers amongst other subjects how having the correct mindset can bring you all you want out of life.<br>

            <p class="about-text">Solve Your Problems And Achieve Your Goals Quickly
              Through Mind Power Techniques
              <br>
              There are different methods for achieving your goals in life. The conventional recipe is the acknowledged method of ‘hard work’ and struggle. We have heard of famous personalities who had achieved great success by sheer dint of hard work and persistence. Unfortunately, however, most of the hard-working people do not achieve any significant level of success, leaving a trail of frustration and dejection. The methods adopted would be deemed to serve our ends, if they not only enable achievement of goals but solve our problems as well.<br>

              It is an axiom that whatever we are, we owe it to our state of mind only. The human mind is, truly, an energy-pack of immeasurable potentialities. Most of the success achievers have got their goals accomplished by the use, consciously or unconsciously, of a little-known method, which has now come to be known as ‘mental reprogramming’ or ‘mind power activation’. This is the concept used by the different commercial courses like Silva Mind Control, Mind Dynamics, Alpha Mind Power etc. All mental programming methods teach you how to tap the enormous, albeit, ‘magic’ power of your subconscious mind.<br>
              
              Prof. William James, considered to be the greatest American psychologist of modern times, declared :”The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings, by changing the inner attitudes of their minds, can change the outer aspects of their lives.” That is, we can SOLVE our problems and ACHIEVE our goals more EASILY and QUICKLY by changing the images in our subconscious mind.
              
              Repeated affirmations and visualisation are the means by which strong images are implanted in the Subconscious mind, which then goes into action to bring the desired goal into manifestation in the physical world by altering the existing reality to match the new projection. This happens because the ‘outer’ is only a reflection of the ‘inner’ and once the inner picture changes, the outer picture has to, necessarily, change. Circumstances, events and even people then gravitate toward the individual concerned to materialise the new reality !<br>
              
              It has been found, by extensive scientific research, that the most productive level for impacting the subconscious mind is the Alpha level of brainwave activity, when the brain pulsations slow down to 8-12 cycles per second as against the normal, conscious level of 14-20 cycles per second, called the Beta level. The ‘alpha’ level can be easily achieved by taking some deep breaths, by rolling both the eyes upward, counting backwards from 100 to 1 or 50 to 1 or by simply playing ‘slow Baroque’ music in the backgound. Through intensive reprogramming of the mind at the alpha level, we can change any situation to meet our desires or requirements. The so-called ‘impossible’ then becomes ‘possible’, so-called ‘coincidences’ occur with increased regularity and whatever we want becomes attainable.<br>
              
              Essentially, the technique involves:<br>
              a) writing down your desires clearly<br>
              b) picturising them vividly as if they have already manifested<br>
              c) affirming the perfect fulfillment of the desires<br>
              d) giving thanks, in advance, to God, the Supreme Architect of the Universe and<br>
              e) taking immediate, tangible action on the ideas which flow into your mind on the trail of the above four steps.<br>
              
              It has been found that regular use of this method brings fabulous results within a few months (in some cases, within weeks!), even if the same had appeared impossible or totally unlikely in the beginning or even at total variance with all the sensory evidence around the individual. Money has been obtained, career goals acccomplished, relationship problems solved and illnesses have been banished using this time-tested method.</p>

              <h2 class="about-title">Law of Attraction – How to Create a Vision Board</h2>
              <p class ="about=text">Part of having a dream is to set your goal, and then to imagine or visualize the different aspects of your dream. A vision board is a tool you can use to help visualize your dream — it helps with your visualizing because you have pictures and images (or small objects) that are more tangible reminders of what you’ve imagined. Vision boards are like a positive affirmation — a message you are sending to the Universe that “This is what I want”. A vision board can help to make your dream seem more real.<br><br>

                I have made many vision boards over the years, which have often ended up in a drawer or on a shelf somewhere. But, here’s the cool thing…years later, I have found these old vision boards and looked at them, and realized that the essence of everything on those vision boards had manifested in my life! In some cases, I manifested exactly what was on my vision board! So I know they work!
                
                Making your own vision board is lots of fun! There are many ways you can put a vision board together — and it doesn’t have to actually be a board. You can use a large sheet of paper or cardboard; a cork notice board; you can make a scrapbook or even use a whole wall. You can even make little movies or videos — the simple movie making/editing programs that come ready installed in most computers work well for making your own dream vision videos. Be guided by what feels exciting and right for you — and make your vision board uniquely your own.<br>
                
                Now, you need to find images and pictures (or even small objects) that help represent the essence of your dream — you will know if they are the right ones because you will feel uplifted, energized, and excited as you imagine yourself experiencing those manifestations. The internet is a fabulous resource for images; you can also browse magazines, catalogues, newspapers — anything that you can cut pictures from; or you could draw or paint your own images. As you gather your images and objects and place them on your vision board (or into your video), keep imagining yourself experiencing those manifestations, and enjoy the positive emotions flowing through you, as a result.<br>
                
                You can also include on your board or in your video any positive words, or affirmations that resonate strongly with you. Again, there are no rules with any of this — just go with what feels right for you. If you are making a dream vision video, you can also add some music to give your movie some extra oomph. Make sure that your words and affirmations feel good when you read and say them…the same applies with the music you choose for your video.<br>
                
                Once you have your vision board or video assembled; to get the most out of it, make sure you are already feeling good when you look at it.<br>
                
                The reason this is so important is that if you are feeling negative and start trying to visualize yourself experiencing your dreams, it would be like arguing with yourself — the part of you that feels negative will dig-in even deeper, and create resistance to what you want…which does not help you create positive change and manifest your desires.<br>
                
                So, if you feel positive emotion about something (it doesn’t matter what the subject is), go and look at your vision board or your movie, and build that positive energy into a more powerful stream. Pretty soon, you will start seeing evidence that your dreams and visions are coming closer and will soon become reality.</p>

              </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              2. Focus on your breath. Where do you feel your breath most? In your belly? In your nose? Try to keep your attention on your inhale and exhale.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              3. Follow your breath for two minutes. Take a deep inhale, expanding your belly, and then exhale slowly, elongating the out-breath as your belly contracts.
            </p>

              Welcome back. What happened? How long was it before your mind wandered away from your breath? Did you notice how busy your mind was even without consciously directing it to think about anything in particular? Did you notice yourself getting caught up in thoughts before you came back to reading this? We often have little narratives running in our minds that we didn’t choose to put there, like: “Why DOES my boss want to meet with me tomorrow?” “I should have gone to the gym yesterday.” “I’ve got to pay some bills” or (the classic) “I don’t have time to sit still, I’ve got stuff to do.”

Once you understand the Law of Attraction, and how it works, you can begin to consciously and intentionally create a better life.

You can choose to respond differently to the situations that arise during your day.

You can choose to think differently.

You can choose to focus and think about the things you want more of in your life.

You can choose to experience more of the things that make you feel good.

You can choose to deliberately participate in the creation of your future by managing your thoughts and feelings.

Using the Law of Attraction is a three-step process: ask, believe and receive. Let’s go into detail on each aspect.

                 <h2 class="service-title">The Law of Attraction in Love and Relationships</a></h2>

<br>

If you want to create an abundance of love in your life, then focus on love. Be the love you want to attract.

Become more loving and generous with others and with yourself. By creating the vibration of love, you will automatically draw more love into your life.

Focus on whatever it is that you want to create more of in your life, and remember to be grateful for that which you already have.

Gratitude itself is a form of abundance, and the vibrational frequency of gratitude and appreciation will automatically attract even more to be grateful for.
