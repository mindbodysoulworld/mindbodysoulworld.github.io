            <h2 class="about-title">What Law of attraction is?</h2>

            <p class="about-text">
Simply put, the Law of Attraction says that you will attract into your life whatever you focus on. Whatever you give your energy and attention to will come back to you.

So, if you stay focused on the good and positive things in your life, you will automatically attract more good and positive things into your life. If you are focused upon lack and negativity, then that is what will be attracted into your life.

Here’s how it works:

Like attracts like. If you are feeling excited, enthusiastic, passionate, happy, joyful, appreciative, or abundant, then you are sending out positive energy.
              </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              The Law of Attraction is one of life’s biggest mysteries. Very few people are fully aware of how much of an impact the Law of Attraction has on their day to day life. Whether we are doing it knowingly or unknowingly, every second of our existence, we are acting as human magnets sending out our thoughts and emotions and attracting back more of what we have put out.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              Unfortunately, so many of us still blind to the potential that is locked deep within us. Consequently, 
              it is all too easy to leave your thoughts and emotions unchecked. This sends out the wrong thoughts and attracts more unwanted emotions and events into your life.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
              Having said this, discovering that the Law of Attraction is at work within your life should be a great cause for celebration! Once the power of attraction has been understood by you it is no longer secret. Plus, you have learned how to effectively apply these to your everyday life, your entire future is yours to create.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
The Law of Attraction is the most powerful law in the universe. Just like gravity, it is always in effect, always in motion. It is working in your life at this very moment. You are always in a state of creation. You are creating your reality in every moment of every day. You are creating your future with every single thought: either consciously or subconsciously. You can’t take a break from it and decide not to create because creation never stops.

Understanding just how the Law of Attraction is a fundamental key to your success. If you want to change your life, and empower yourself to create an amazing future, then you need to understand your role in the Law of Attraction.

Expect miracles.working consciously with your energy (thoughts, feelings and beliefs) you can make that experience more awesome.

The Law of Attraction allows for infinite possibilities, infinite abundance, and infinite joy. It knows no order of difficulty, and it can change your life in every way.

In order to really understand how the Law of Attraction works in your life, we need to look at a few things. I will explain the Law of Attraction, how to master it in your life to attract success in many areas, a meditation technique, and some tips for abundance.

Let’s start at the beginning.

            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
Once you understand the Law of Attraction, and how it works, you can begin to consciously and intentionally create a better life.

You can choose to respond differently to the situations that arise during your day.

You can choose to think differently.

You can choose to focus and think about the things you want more of in your life.

You can choose to experience more of the things that make you feel good.

You can choose to deliberately participate in the creation of your future by managing your thoughts and feelings.

Using the Law of Attraction is a three-step process: ask, believe and receive. Let’s go into detail on each aspect.
              </p>
              <p class="about-text">
                 <h2 class="service-title">1. Ask the universe for what you want, not for what you don’t want</a></h2>


Every day, you send out requests to the universe—as well as to your subconscious mind—in the form of thoughts: literally, what you think about, read about, talk about, and give your attention to. Unfortunately, what we give our attention to is often random and not deliberate, you simply respond to situations.
Because the Law of Attraction states that you’ll attract into your life whatever you give your energy, focus, and attention to—wanted or unwanted.

You must become more deliberate about what you think and feel.

To become more intentional about the thoughts you offer the universe, you’ll need to decide what you want—but also practice feeling those emotions you’ll experience when you have it.

Perhaps you want to change career, move to another state, win a major professional award, have your own TV show, or recover from a major illness.

    How would you feel once you’ve “arrived” at your goal?
    What would you be doing throughout your day?
    Who would you be spending time with?

The more you focus on and talk about what you DO want (instead of what you don’t want), the faster you will manifest your dreams and goals.
              </p>

              <p class="about-text">
                <h2 class="service-title">2. Believe that you’ll get what you want, then take action</a></h2>


What does it mean to believe you’ll get what you want?

It means maintaining a positive expectancy, going about your day with certainty— knowing that you’ve put your future in the hands of powers that are greater than yours. It’s deciding with conviction that what you want will absolutely happen.

This is not always easy.

Many people have limiting beliefs which keep them from allowing abundance and happiness into their lives. If this describes you, realize that you must first change your limiting beliefs into thoughts that you are deserving, worthy, lovable, desirable, and capable—as well as smart enough, strong enough, attractive enough, rich enough, good enough, and “enough” in every other way that matters to you.

Once you believe that you’ll get what you want, the second part of the equation is to take action.
Taking the actions that would create your desired result affirms your belief that what you want is within reach.
              </p>
               <p class="about-text">
                 <h2 class="service-title">3. Receive what you want by becoming a vibrational match for it</a></h2>


In order to receive that which you are intending, you must become a “vibrational match” for what you want to attract into your life.

The easiest way to become a vibrational match is to focus on creating positive emotions of love, joy, appreciation, and gratitude throughout your day. You can also practice feeling the emotions you would be experiencing if you already had what you wanted. You can also create these emotions through the thoughts that you think. In fact, your thoughts are creating feelings all the time, so it’s important to catch yourself when your emotions turn negative and turn them to positive emotions.

As with everything, this takes time and practice. However, the more you put a conscious effort into attracting what you want, and following these steps, the easier it will become.

You can begin to expect miracles.
               </p>


               <p  class="about-text">
                 <h2 class="service-title">The Law of Attraction in Love and Relationships</a></h2>

<br>

If you want to create an abundance of love in your life, then focus on love. Be the love you want to attract.

Become more loving and generous with others and with yourself. By creating the vibration of love, you will automatically draw more love into your life.

Focus on whatever it is that you want to create more of in your life, and remember to be grateful for that which you already have.

Gratitude itself is a form of abundance, and the vibrational frequency of gratitude and appreciation will automatically attract even more to be grateful for.
               </p>

                <p  class="about-text">
                  <h2 class="service-title">A Law of Attraction Meditation for Guidance</a></h2>

<br>
Take time each day to step away from the clutter and the noise. A daily commitment to spend time in this still, quiet place is a commitment to clarity and inner peace.

We need this time and space in our lives in order to remember who we really are, what’s important, and where our personal truth lies. It is our time to calm the spirit and soothe the soul.

You can learn how to meditate in many different ways, but in general, they consist of simply being still and quiet for a period of time and focusing your attention on either your breath or a mantra of some sort.

If you are new to the practice of meditation—your thoughts will drift, and your mind will wander at first. Remember not to be hard on yourself when this happens. This is just part of learning how to meditate.

If you have never meditated before, here’s a simple structure of exercises you can use to begin.

<br>
    1. Find a quiet place, close your eyes, and focus on slowing down your breathing.<br>
    2. Repeat an uplifting word or phrase.<br>
    3. Move into a state of quiet.<br>
    4. Imagine yourself surrounded by a sphere of light.<br>

The regular practice of meditation will help clear your mind of distractions, cleanse your thoughts, and enhance your spiritual connection. It renews the spirit, relaxes the body, and calms the soul.
